# CAD Designs

This folder contains the 3D models of the microscope in several stages of subdivision. The complete microscope design is contained in [Microscope-Full](https://github.com/Joshedwards222/LifeHack/blob/master/Designs/CAD/Main-Body.step)

It is usually easier to interrogate the designs on a modular level:
* [Excitation-Module](https://github.com/Joshedwards222/LifeHack/blob/master/Designs/CAD/Excitation-Module.step)
* [Beam-Expansion-Module](https://github.com/Joshedwards222/LifeHack/blob/master/Designs/CAD/Beam-Expansion-Module.step)
* [Main-Body](https://github.com/Joshedwards222/LifeHack/blob/master/Designs/CAD/Main-Body.step)
